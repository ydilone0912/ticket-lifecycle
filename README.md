<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

1- Ticket submission: The customer submits a support request via the osTicket web interface, email, or another channel.

2- Ticket triage: The ticket is reviewed and categorized by the system, based on the criteria configured by the admin. The ticket may be automatically assigned to a department or staff member based on these criteria.

3- Ticket assignment: The ticket is manually or automatically assigned to a staff member, based on the department's workload, expertise, or other criteria.

4- Ticket response: The staff member reviews the ticket and responds to the customer with a resolution, workaround, or request for additional information.

5- Ticket resolution: The staff member resolves the ticket by providing a solution to the customer's issue or marking the ticket as "resolved" if no further action is needed.

6- Ticket closure: The ticket is closed by the staff member or automatically closed by the system if it meets certain criteria such as being inactive for a set period of time.

7- Ticket follow-up: The system may automatically send a follow-up email to the customer to confirm that their issue has been resolved and to request feedback on the support experience.

8- Ticket analysis: The admin can analyze the performance of the support team and the system, using the built-in reporting tools to track metrics such as ticket volume, response time, and customer satisfaction.
